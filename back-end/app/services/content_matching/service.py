  # Early Humans

History is the story of humans in the
past. It tells what people did and what happened to them. Historians are people who
study and write about the human past.
They define history as the period of time
that began after people learned to write,
about 5,500 years ago. But the story of people really begins in prehistory—the time
before people developed writing.

## Tools of Discovery

What we know about
the earliest people comes from the things
they left behind. Scientists have worked
to uncover clues about early human life.
Anthropologists (AN •thruh • PAH•luh •jihsts)
focus on human society. They study how
humans developed and how they related
to one another. Archaeologists (AHR • kee •
AH•luh •jihsts) hunt for evidence buried in
the ground where settlements might once
have been. They dig up and study artifacts
(AHR•tih• FAKTS)—weapons, tools, and other
things made by humans. They also look for
fossils (FAH•suhls)—traces of plants or animals that have been preserved in rock.
British archaeologists Louis and Mary
Leakey and their son Richard are probably
the most-famous fossil hunters. Their findings convinced many scientists and anthropologists that the ancestors of human
beings first appeared somewhere in East
Africa millions of years ago

In the 1930s, Louis and Mary Leakey
began digging for fossils in the Olduvai
Gorge in Tanzania. Archaeologists know
that in certain areas of the world, layers of
dirt and rock have been piled up slowly
over time by the action of wind and water.
If you dig in those places, the deeper you
find things, the older they are, because they
were buried further back in time. The
Olduvai Gorge is very deep, and along its
walls are layers of dirt from as far back as 2
million years ago. This made it a very good
location to look for fossils.
In the 1940s and 1950s, Louis and Mary
found many fossils of hominids. Hominids
are creatures that walk on two legs. Human
beings are the only type of hominid still
alive today. All the others are extinct.
Anthropologists think that human beings
developed from earlier types of hominids.
In 1959 Mary Leakey discovered the
skull of a creature nearly 2 million years
old. This showed that hominids lived at
least that long ago. In 1974 Donald Johanson, an American anthropologist from
Chicago, made an even more amazing discovery. He unearthed nearly an entire skeleton of a female hominid in Ethiopia. The
hominid was nicknamed Lucy and was
nearly 3 million years old.
Before Lucy was found, anthropologists
thought hominids lived in the open on
Africa’s plains and used tools to hunt other
animals. They thought hominids had begun
walking on two legs so they could carry
their tools while they hunted. Lucy’s
remains showed that hominids began walking on two legs long before they used tools.
Scientists’ ideas about hominids were
changed again in 1992. That year Tim
White, an anthropologist from California,
uncovered a hominid that was 4.4 million
years old. Its teeth and bones showed that hominids had begun walking on two legs
while living in Africa’s rain forests, before
they moved out onto Africa’s plains.
Based on the work of these and other
anthropologists, many scientists today think
that the first human beings developed in
East Africa. Slowly, over thousands of years,
human beings spread out of Africa, probably
in search of food and new places to live as
their population increased. Gradually, they
settled throughout the world.

## Who Were the Hunter-Gatherers?

Historians call the prehistoric period of
human history the Stone Age. The name
comes from the fact that people during this
time used stone to make tools and weapons.
The earliest part of the period is the
Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. Paleolithic means “old stone” in the Greek language.
Paleolithic times began roughly 2.5 million
years ago and lasted until around 8000 B.C.
Try to imagine the world during the
Stone Age, long before any roadways, farms,
or villages existed. Early humans spent most
of their time searching for food. They hunted
animals, caught fish, ate insects, and gathered nuts, berries, fruits, grains, and plants.
Because they hunted and gathered food,
Paleolithic people were always on the
move. They were nomads (NOH• MADS), or
people who regularly move from place to
place without fixed homes. They traveled in
bands or groups of 30 or so members
because it was safer and made the search
for food easier.

Men and women did different tasks
within the group. Women stayed close to the
campsite, which was typically near a stream
or other water source. They cared for the
children and searched nearby woods and
meadows for berries, nuts, and grains.
Men hunted animals—an activity that
sometimes took them far from camp. They
had to learn the habits of animals and make
tools for hunting. At first, they used clubs
or drove the animals off cliffs. Over time,
Paleolithic people invented spears, traps,
and bows and arrows.

## Adapting to the Environment

The way
that Paleolithic people lived depended on
where they lived. Those in warm climates
needed little clothing or shelter. People in
cold climates sought protection from the
weather in caves. Over time, Paleolithic
people created new kinds of shelter. The
most common was probably made of animal hides held up by wooden poles.
Paleolithic people made a life-changing
discovery when they learned to tame fire.
Fire gave warmth to those gathered around
it. It lit the darkness and scared away wild animals. Food cooked over the fire tasted
better and was easier to digest. In addition,
cooked meat could be kept longer.
Archaeologists believe that early humans
started fires by rubbing two pieces of wood
together. Paleolithic people later made drilllike wooden tools to start fires.

## What Were the Ice Ages?

Paleolithic people needed fire in order to survive the Ice
Ages. These were long periods of extreme
cold. The last Ice Age began about 100,000
B.C. From then until about 8000 B.C., thick
ice sheets covered parts of Europe, Asia,
and North America.

The Ice Age was a threat to human life.
People risked death from the cold and also
from hunger. Early humans had to adapt
by changing their diet, building sturdier
shelters, and using animal furs to make
warm clothing. The mastery of fire helped
people live in this environment.

## Language, Art, and Religion

Another
advance during Paleolithic times was the
development of spoken language. Language
made it far easier for people to work
together and to pass on knowledge.
Early people expressed themselves not
only in words but in art. They crushed yellow, black, and red rocks to make powders
for paint. Then they dabbed this on cave
walls, creating scenes of lions, oxen, panthers, and other animals. Historians are not
sure why cave paintings were created. They
may have had religious meaning or been
used to explain people’s role in the uniTools One of the most important
advances of prehistoric people was
the creation of stone tools. Tools
made hunting, gathering, building
shelter, and making clothing much
easier.
The first tools were made of
stones. Early humans quickly
verse. Early people also might have
thought that painting an animal would
bring good luck in the hunt.

## The Invention of Tools

Paleolithic people
were the first to use technology (tehk•NAH•
luh •jee)—tools and methods that help
humans perform tasks. People often used a
stone called flint to make tools. By hitting
flint with a hard stone, they could make it
flake into pieces with very sharp edges. To
make hand axes or hunting spears, they
tied wooden poles to pieces of flint that
were the right shape for the tool.
Over time, early people grew more
skilled at making tools. They crafted smaller
and sharper tools, such as fishhooks and
needles made from animal bones. They
used needles to make nets and baskets and
to sew animal hides together for clothing.

# The Agricultural Revolution

After the last Ice Age ended, people
entered the Mesolithic Age. Mesolithic
means “middle stone” in Greek. At this
time, people changed from hunting to herding animals. They began to domesticate (duh
•MEHS•tih• KAYT), or tame animals for human
use. Animals provided meat, milk, and
wool. They also carried goods and people
and pulled carts. Even so, most Mesolithic
people remained nomadic. They moved
from place to place in search of grass to feed
their herds. They also continued to gather
seeds, fruits, and vegetables to eat.
The Mesolithic Age came to an end
when people made another important discovery. They realized that they could plant
seeds and grow their own food. They may
have learned this from the seeds they had
stored in dirt pits. Some of the seeds might
have sprouted and shown people that if
they put seeds in dirt and waited long
enough, they could grow plants.
With this new knowledge, people could
stay in one place and grow grains and vegetables. Gradually, farming began to
replace hunting and gathering for many
people. They began to build villages and
claim land for their farms. This changed the
way people lived and marked the beginning of the Neolithic Age, or New Stone
Age, which began about 8000 B.C. and
lasted until about 4000 B.C.

## Why Was Farming Important?

Historians call the changes in the
Neolithic Age the agricultural revolution. The word revolution
refers to changes that greatly affect
many areas of life. Some historians consider the farming revolution the most important event in
human history.
Farming did not begin in one
region and spread. People in different parts of the world discovered
how to grow crops at about the
same time. In Asia, people grew
wheat, barley, rice, soybeans, and a
grain called millet. In Mexico,
farmers grew corn, squash, and
potatoes. In Africa, they grew millet and a grain called sorghum.
Farming greatly increased the
number of calories that could be produced from an area of land. This made it
possible to feed more people and led to an
increase in the world’s population. Farming
regions also had a higher population density. People lived closer together and did
not have to spread out as much as they used
to when they hunted and gathered food.
Farming also changed the kind of food people ate. Instead of a diet rich in meat and vegetables, people now ate a lot of grain—usually
in the form of bread. Anthropologists think that
people in the early days of farming were not as
healthy as hunter-gatherers because they did
not have enough variety in their diet.
Farming required people to stay in one
place for a long time. This made it easier for
diseases to spread and infect many people.
Because people stayed in one place, they
also tended to pollute their environment.
Their water became dirty, and they left
garbage near their farms. This too helped
the spread of disease.
People had to work harder and for much
longer hours when farming. People had to
till the soil in order to plant seeds. They had
to weed the fields by hand. Then they had to
gather the crops by hand when they were
ready. There were no machines to make the
work quick and easy. People had to walk
through their fields, often bent over at the
waist, gathering the crops they had grown.
Despite the problems of diet and disease
and the hard work people had to do, the
farming revolution greatly improved the
lives of most people. Fewer people starved
to death, and more children lived to adulthood. Settling in one place to farm also led
to a much more organized society and
made possible the world’s first towns and
cities.

## The Growth of Villages

People who
farmed could settle in one place. Herders
remained nomadic and drove their animals
wherever they could find grazing land.
Farmers, however, had to stay close to their
fields to water the plants, keep hungry animals away, and harvest their crops. They
began to live in villages, where they built
permanent homes.
During the Neolithic Age, villages were
started in Europe, India, Egypt, China, and
Mexico. Some of the earliest known communities have been found in the Middle East.
One of the oldest is Jericho (JEHR•ih• KOH) in
the West Bank between what are now Israel
and Jordan. It dates back to about 8000 B.C.
Another well-known Neolithic community is Çatal Hüyük (chah • TAHL hoo •
YOOK) in present-day Turkey. Little of the
community remains, but it was home to
some 6,000 people between about 6700 B.C.
and 5700 B.C. These people lived in simple
mud-brick houses that were packed tightly
together and decorated inside with wall
paintings. They used other buildings as
places of worship. Along with farming, the
people hunted, raised sheep and goats, and
ate fish and bird eggs from nearby marshes.

## The Benefits of a Settled Life

Neolithic
people found greater security by living in
settled communities. Steady food supplies
led to healthy, growing populations. Soon
villagers produced a food surplus. That is,
they grew more food than they needed.
They were able to trade their extra food for
other goods made by people in their community or who lived nearby.
The food surplus made it possible for
people to practice specialization (SPEH•shuh•
luh•ZAY•shuhn), or the development of different kinds of jobs. Because not everyone was
needed for farming, some people had the
time to develop other types of skills. They
made pottery from clay to store their grain
and other foods. Others used plant fibers to
make mats and to weave cloth. This led to a
new type of clothing. Early humans had
worn only animal skins. Now people could
use wool and other fabrics for clothes as well.
These craftspeople, like farmers, also took
part in trade. They exchanged the things they
made for goods they did not have.
In late Neolithic times, people continued to make advances. Toolmakers created
better farming tools, such as the sickle for
cutting grain. In some places, people began
to work with metals. At first they used copper. They heated rocks to melt the copper
inside and then poured the melted copper
into molds for tools and weapons.
After 4000 B.C., craftspeople in western
Asia mixed copper and tin to form a metal
called bronze. Bronze was harder and
longer lasting than copper. It became
widely used between 3000 B.C. and 1200
B.C., the period known as the Bronze Age.
